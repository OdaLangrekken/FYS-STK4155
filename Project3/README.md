This is the repository for FYS-STK4155 Project 3.

The main notebook used to produce the results in this project can be found at 'project3_code/notebooks/Classifying Clothing.ipynb'.

All code created for the project is in the 'project3_code' directory. The directory contains notebooks and exercise scripts used for solving the project exercises, benchmarking scripts used to produce benchmarking output and the module 'project3_code'. The module includes code for all methods used in the project. Additionally, the module contains some unit tests that can be run by running the shell script in 'Project3/run_tests.sh'.

The project3_code module can be installed by navigating to the 'Project3/project3_code'-folder in the terminal and typing ```pip install .```. Other dependencies are numpy, sklearn, matplotlib and pandas.

The outut folder contains figures and numerical outputs produced by the code. In the 'benchmarks' folder you can find output from the unit tests as well as output from the various benchmarking scripts.
